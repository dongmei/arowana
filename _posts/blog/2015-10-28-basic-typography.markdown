This is a study note to summarise some basic typography, after taking the coursera course Fundamentals of Graphic Design by Michael Worthington from the California Institute of The Arts, and some online courses. <!--more-->

<h3> How to communicate on typography – basic terminology </h3>
In order to communicate with graphic designers, first we need to learn about the terminology to have a common language.

<h3> How to choose the right size?</h3>
    
The Point System is used to measure and represent the type size. 1pt equals to 1/72 in, roughly 0.35mm. In the old days for printing, the type was actually set on metal and that metal was used on a printing press to print letter forms. So each letter form was a raised piece of type and it had a body behind it and had a solid piece of metal behind it. The block of lead behind the type , and the body would have  a uniform size so that the type could be lined up on a press in order to print it.

Then the question comes, how to choose the right size, or point? Below is a thumb of rule for choosing Headlines/Subheads/Body Text/Footnotes in printing, and still serves as a good guideline for digital applications.

<h3> How to choose a typeface?</h3>

Before we talk about the selection of typefaces, let’s take a look at the typeface family. There are two big groups: Serif and San Serif. One distinct feature of Serif is that the Serif has decorative flourishes at the end of the stroke for the letter forms. This make Serif look more classic and decorative, while San Serif is more clean and modern.

There are hundreds of discussions and online posts talking about which one to use, Serif or San Serif. Some talks that Serif works better for printed work, while San Serif for online work. Personally, I think there is no such rule of thumb which one should be used for which application, as long as the chosen typeface meets the following guidelines:


<ol>
	<li> Think about content </li>
	<li> Self-proof review </li>
	<li> Audience and application </li>
	<li> Peer review and platform proof review </li>
</ol>

 

Serif can be further categorised into the following subgroups:
