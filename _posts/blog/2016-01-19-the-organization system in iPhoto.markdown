The information architect in iPhoto is a hybrid of exact organization scheme and ambiguous organization scheme. <!--more-->

An exact Organization Scheme in the Chronological order is the default display in iPhoto. 
First we look at the Login Page. It displaces all photos under Albums in a chronological order without any breaker in-between. Only the overall date range was displayed on the top left corner.

For a display of all photos in a clearer chronological order, i.e. section by section according to timeline, you could click Photo, the first item in the operation column on the right. Bonus point, geographical information is also displayed beside the date, as long as there is available metadata of the pictures

Next, the ambiguous organization schemes…

iPhoto Events
This corresponds to the Topic under ambiguous organization schemes. I organise the photos by event, or by topic. Usually, I import all photos based on activities such as hiking trips, hangout with friends, visit to museum etc. I will add metadata like location (if not captured by the camera), faces and more importantly keywords. I use keywords the same way as tags in blogs, so this helps later when I need to sort out all photos under the same topic.

iPhoto Default Albums:

The default albums of Faces, Last Import etc, as shown in the screenshot below, resemble the Task under ambiguous organization schemes. Users may know exactly what they are looking for. Take Faces as an example. I’d like to choose a profile picture for a temporary enter pass, and the selection criteria is clear and recently taken (as long as it could be recognised). More importantly it has to be a nice shot cause I need to wearing the pass for the whole day, and I want to look nice. All I need to do is go to Faces album, and open all the photos under my Face. 

Photos are displayed in two different schemes: Photos and Faces. In this case, Faces will be my choice since it zoom in the photos and focus on my face. With a glimpse, I’ll be able to quickly filter out the improper ones: my face too close to others’, blur photos, side views and so on. All the photos are displayed in a chronological order, so I could the more recent photos easily by scrolling down. Finally I found the photos that satisfies me as a profile picture.

Smart Albums
Remember the metadata I have added to all photos while importing? Now they come in play in the Smart Albums. To create a new smart album of my hiking trips, I will use Keyword of Hiking as the filter condition. Then all my hiking photos are collected in this album, provided I have tagged my photos properly.

The more fantastic feature in iPhoto’s information organization system is, I can always edit my smart album by changing and/or adding filter conditions like Date, Album and so on. This allows me to narrow down my selections with simple Boolean alike expression. In this case, I’d like to retrieve the photos of food (Keyword #2) that I have had during the hiking (Keyword #1) trip in Lombok (Album). Remember to change the condition from “Match any…” to “Match all…” before click OK.

All the photos come out qutie fast, depending on the amount of photos to be processed. This method of organising photos saves me countless time in searching and organising photos.
