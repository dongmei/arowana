The navigation systems in a website or APP are composed of three components: the embedded, the supplemental and the advanced. Each component has its own purpose and function, and to be used by visitors in different scenarios. <!--more-->

<h3>The Embedded Navigation System</h3>
There are three major systems are wrapped around and infused within the content of the site: a gloal system is for site-wide usage like a navigation bar; a local system allows user to explore teh immediate area; and a contextual navigation creates links to a particular page, document or object.

<h3>The Supplemental Navigation System</h3>
Sitemaps, search, indexes and guides are external to teh basic hierarchy of a website, and complement the embedded navigation systems. Supplemental navigation systems can be critical factors for ensuring usability and finability, and works as the backup  when the embedded navigation system fails users.

<h3>The Advanced Navigation System</h3>
The embedded and supplemental navigation system build the fundamental blocks for the navigation system, while the advanced introduces further flexiility and findability. Meanwhile, it might increase the complexity of the navigation system. Some major advanced components are personalization that make suggestions based on users' past behaviors, customization that gives user more control, social navigation that is based on a collective response of the mainstream adoption. All these advanced navigation works well in a limited contexts, and might bring in a better or worse user experience. 

The design of navigation systems has undergone a rapid development and improvement. If you are interested, you may have a check onthe Internet Archive's Wayback Machine (<a href="http://www.archive.org/"> http://www.archive.org/ </a>) to learn more about past designs.
