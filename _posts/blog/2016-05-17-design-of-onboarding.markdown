In <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/06/complete-roadmap-building-delightful-onboarding-experience-mobile-app-users/" target="_blank">this article</a>, Anton Kosolapov draws a roadmap on how to build a delightful onboarding experiences. <!--more--> 

My takeaways:
<ul>
	<li>Onboarding experiences should be delightful and engaging;</li>
	<li>It should convey the main purpose of the product by 80/20 rules;</li>
	<li>It should tell user clearly what are the benefits of us;</li>
	<li>It is part of the overall user experiences, and does not end at the sign-up pages;</li>
	<li>Use onboarding only when necessary.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Why design of onboarding is important</h3>
When launching an app, there are four things to show users clearly to retain them in your app:
<ol>
	<li>Why they need the app</li>
	<li>what the app can do for them</li>
	<li>what are its most important features</li>
	<li>how to use these features</li>
</ol>

The design of on boarding should follow the 80/20 rule: to teach people on features that they will spend 80% of their time using, and explain why those features are so useful. 

<h3>Types of onboarding design</h3>
<ul>
	<li><b>Introductory slides</b> or <b>video</b></li>
	<li><b>Tips</b>: use specific terms to make the explanation easy to understand and follow</li>
	<li>Interface tour</li>
	<li>Content samples</li>
	<li><b>Onboarding wizard</b>: might be the best strategy for an app that has to cater to various tastes</li>
	<li>hybrid solution</li>
</ul>

<h3>Design Strategies</h3>
<ol>	
	<li>Emotional apeal
		<ol>
			<li>Trigger positive emotion in an early stage to make user come back;</li>
			<li>Criteria to evaluate whether onboarding speaks to emotion
				<ul>
					<li>the navigation makes sense and is easily understood; </li>
					<li>the design is visually appealling to the target audience; </li>
					<li>moving through the slides is so enjoyable that the user wants to continue; </li>
					<li>the entire onboarding experience is memorable and personal, reflecting the personality of the brand and its customers.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li>Show what users can do
		<ul>
			<li>the purpose of the app</li>
			<li>the benefits for users</li>
		</ul>
	</li>	
	<li>Draw attention to competitive advantages</li>
	<li>Explain with content samples
		<ul>
			<li>Content samples are primarily used in productivity and document-editing apps. You could always combine content samples with tips and slides.</li>
		</ul>	
	</li>
	<li>Make the first impression have a lasting impact: nudge user to take an action</li>
	<li>Progressive learning
		<ul>
			<li>suitable for large and technically sophisticated projects with a high threshold for entry</li>
			<li>usually includes a system of assignments</li>
		</ul>	
	</li>
</ol>

<h3>Design Elements</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Buttons and navigation</li>
	<li>Tips
		<ul>
			<li>Be clear and specific</li>
			<li>Show up in a certain order to: 
				<ul>
					<li>to emphasize active elements</li>
					<li>as textual hints</li>
					<li>in popup windows</li>
					<li>to fill up blank areas of the screen</li>
				</ul>	
			</li>
			<li>Allow user to skip</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Text: for things to be used by user and might be difficult for users to understand</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Brevity & clarity</li>
			<li>Readability</li>
			<li>Composition: match overall design & reflect the mood of the product</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Graphics: illustrations, photos, video, GIFs and screenshots</li>
</ol>

<h3>Design Tools</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Prototyping tools
		<ul>
			<li>Principle</li>
			<li>Pixate</li>
			<li>Flinto</li>
			<li>InVision</li>
			<li>Atomic</li>
			<li>Framer.js (coding required & easier for developers)</li>
			<li>Form (by RelativeWave) (coding required & easier for developers)</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Video editors for animations
		<ul>
			<li>Adobe AE</li>
			<li>Apple Motion</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ol>

<h3>Design Frameworks</h3>
<ol>
	<li>List a few core features of the product.</li>
	<li>Identify the product’s value proposition.</li>
	<li>Write down your competitive advantage and how the product is positioned in the market.</li>
	<li>Describe one specific use case for the app.</li>
	<li>Choose the most appropriate onboarding strategy to convey the app’s value.</li>
	<li>Design the graphic elements and navigation flow.</li>
	<li>Create an interactive prototype of your onboarding design.</li>
	<li>Test the prototype.</li>
	<li>Iterate to improve the experience.</li>
	<li>Measure the effectiveness with analytics and user testing.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Common Mistakes By Designers</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Explain obvious details</li>
	<li>Too long (resulting in negative motion)</li>
	<li>Unclear (resulting in misunderstanding)</li>
	<li>Not unique design</li>
	<li>Do onboard for the sake of it</li>
