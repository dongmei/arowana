description: As an exploration in prototyping and website design, I have been working on the redesign of the website for Tokyo Marathon. Thoroughly challenging thinking through the wireframing and prototyping but ultimately rewarding.

Tokyo Marathon is listed as Top 10 World’s Best Marathons, while the event website is not up to the same standard. While I was registering for the 2016 race, my friends and I had difficulties in finding information and navigating through the web page. So I decided to take a closer look at the website, and explore how to make an improved site that is more effective, more engaging and more interactive.

	<h3> RESEARCH: CREATING PERSONA </h3>
</div>

<div class="topmargin-sm bottommargin">
	<p>Before diving into the current website, I created a persona to represents a common user experience. That guided me throughout the design process from defining problems to implementing solutions. </p>

	<p>In this case, my target user, John, was an overseas runner. He did not speak Japanese and he had never been to Japan before.</p>

<div class = "heading-block">
	<h3> RESEARCH: ANALYSING CONTENTS </h3>
</div>

<div class="topmargin-sm bottommargin">
	<p>By examine the current website, I was able to use the real content for my redesign work. This helped me make design decisions that would benefit the users and their experiences when interacting with the redesigned website.  </p>

	<p>While sorting through my content, I was also thinking about the content hierarchy - how the contents related and would be laid out - and recognised the Feature, Browse and Search Pattern for Home page content display, and News Stream Pattern to display the latest news. </p>
</div>

<div class="img_row">
		<img class="col-xs-12 col-sm-4 col-md-4" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/project/2015-10-07/Step1.jpg" alt="" title="Listed All Contents"/>

<div class = "heading-block">
	<h3> RESEARCH: CREATING A SITEMAP  </h3>
</div>

<div class="topmargin-sm bottommargin">
	<p> I used Mindnode to create a basic sitemap, which provided a visual aid to the state of the website, and how many pages there might be the the relationship between all of the pages. </p>
</div>

<div class = "heading-block">
	<h3> PROTOTYPING: SKETCHES  </h3>
</div>

<div class="topmargin-sm bottommargin">
	<p> I used pencil and paper to sketch a low-fidelity mockup. This allowed me to focus on the component and information architecture, and freed me from details like colors, typefaces and font sizes. Design elements were drawn on pieces of papers so that each element can be re-positioned to form other possible layouts and structures. Meanwhile, the sorted contents in colors and the sitemap created earlier kept me on track of the important information for visitors. </p>

<div class = "heading-block">
	<h3> PROTOTYPING: WIREFRAME  </h3>
</div>

<div class="topmargin-sm bottommargin">
	<p> Instead of Lorem Lpsum, Real contents were used for the wireframing in Omnigraffle. In this way, I could take a detailed look at the scale, position and typography before I dived into the colourful and pixel-perfect tools like Photoshop.</p>

	</p>More details were added into the design. </p>

	<h3> PROTOTYPING: UI AND INTERACTIONS </h3>
</div>

<div class="topmargin-sm bottommargin">
	<p>The event logo was the basis for the website’s color scheme. Eight numbers of colors were selected to create a colourful and energetic athletic spirit. Tint and saturation were fine-tuned for color harmony.</p>
