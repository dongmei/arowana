description: Interaction design and UI design for ride-hailing application on mobile platform
---

The battle between Uber and Grab is more and more fierce, with the announcement of new partnership and adjustment of riding fares. This projects is comprised of a <b>Competitor Analysis</b> between Uber and Grab, followed by a <b>Proposed New Design</b> of a ride-hailing app similar to Grab for a better user experience. 

<div class = "heading-block">
	<h3> COMPETITOR ANAYLYSIS</h3>
</div>

<h3> 1. Product Positioning </h3>

<div class="topmargin-sm bottommargin">
	<p>Uber is Based in the US, providing global services in 410 cities worldwide. Aimed to provide comfortable and safe transportation services. </p>

	<p>Grab is based in Singapore, services covered in 30 cities in Southeast Asia. Positioned as smart platform for transportation in Southeast Asia while improving lives, safety and accessibility.</p>
</div>

<h3> 2. Challenges </h3>

<div class="topmargin-sm bottommargin">
	<p>
		Both Uber and Grab are faced with common challenges: <br/>

		- <b>Local regulations</b>: private car drivers operating under Uber and Grab are required to have a vocational licence. <br/>

		- <b>Safety</b>: How to ensure both commuter and drivers’ safety, especially for females. 
	</p>
</div>

<h3> 3. Mobile App: User Flow </h3>

<img class="center-img topmargin bottommargin-lg" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/project/2016-04-10/user-flow.jpg" alt="" title="">

<div class="topmargin-sm bottommargin">
	<p>
		<b>Separated profiles and payment</b> <br/>
		in Uber app In Uber, user needs to choose profile (among Personal, Family and Business where available) that links to the preset payment method respectively. In Grab, user needs to choose Tags between Business and Personal, and needs to change payment method manually.  Grab users might take additional steps to configure the profile.
	</p>

	<p>
		<b>Advance booking in Grab </b> <br/>
		Uber only allows instant booking while Grab provides advanced booking.
	</p>

	<p>
		<b>Additional waiting time in Grab</b> <br/>
		There are no major differences in the ideal user flow between the two apps. Since Grab is based on driver’s decision to grab the booking, users may experience additional waiting time for driver to accept the booking, and an extra step for flash booking either taxi or private car occurs when no driver accept the booking. Uber is based on distributing the booking by backend system, thus users are guaranteed to get a car as long as there are cars nearby as shown in the system.

</div>

<h3> 4. APP Features and Structures</h3>

<div class="topmargin-sm bottommargin">
	<p>
		Below are summaries of main features provided in Uber app and Grab app. Uber app enables lots of personalised settings, while Grab provides more variety of car types.

<h3> 5. Visual Design and Interaction Design</h3>

<div class="topmargin-sm bottommargin">
	<p>
		Overall, Uber app’s interaction is simpler compared to Grab. Uber’s colour scheme is of black and blue, targeting at business users at the very start. By contrast, Grab started with taxi ride-hailing services, and its colour scheme is based on green, which represents a safe and easy access to transportation for all users.
