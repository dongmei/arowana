<h3> 2. Challenges </h3>

<div class="topmargin-sm bottommargin">
	<p>
		Both Uber and Grab are faced with common challenges: <br/>

		- <b>Local regulations</b>: private car drivers operating under Uber and Grab are required to have a vocational licence. <br/>

		- <b>Safety</b>: How to ensure both commuter and drivers’ safety, especially for females. 
	</p>
</div>

<div class="topmargin-sm bottommargin">
	<p>
		<b>Separated profiles and payment</b> <br/>
		in Uber app In Uber, user needs to choose profile (among Personal, Family and Business where available) that links to the preset payment method respectively. In Grab, user needs to choose Tags between Business and Personal, and needs to change payment method manually.  Grab users might take additional steps to configure the profile.
	</p>

	<p>
		<b>Advance booking in Grab </b> <br/>
		Uber only allows instant booking while Grab provides advanced booking.
	</p>

	<p>
		<b>Additional waiting time in Grab</b> <br/>
		There are no major differences in the ideal user flow between the two apps. Since Grab is based on driver’s decision to grab the booking, users may experience additional waiting time for driver to accept the booking, and an extra step for flash booking either taxi or private car occurs when no driver accept the booking. Uber is based on distributing the booking by backend system, thus users are guaranteed to get a car as long as there are cars nearby as shown in the system.
