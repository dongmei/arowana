I am a long distance runner and keen to participate in the Tokyo Marathon in 2016. When registrering online, I found it quite difficult to navigate through the website, and the web design was quite outdated. So I have re-designed the site as my own practice.

<br/>
<h3> Low-fidelity Mockup </h3>
<br/>

<div class="img_row">
	<img class="col one" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/design/mockup01.jpg" alt="" title="example image"/>
	<img class="col one" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/design/mockup02.jpg" alt="" title="example image"/>
	<img class="col one" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/design/mockup03.jpg" alt="" title="example image"/>
</div>
<div class="img_row">
	<img class="col one" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/design/mockup04.jpg" alt="" title="example image"/>
	<img class="col one" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/design/mockup05.jpg" alt="" title="example image"/>
	<img class="col one" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/design/mockup06.jpg" alt="" title="example image"/>
</div>
<div class="col three caption">

</div>

Low fidelity mockup is essential in the initial design stage. This allows me to focus on the component and information archtecture, and frees me from details like colors, typefaces and font sizes. Mockup using pencil and paper is the cheapest method. I have drawn design elements on pieces of papers so that each element can be re-positioned to form another possible layout and structure. 

<br/>
<h3> Wireframing </h3>
<br/>

<div>
	<img class="col three" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/design/tokyo-marathon-wireframing.png" alt="" title="example image"/>
</div>
<div class="col three caption">

</div>

Further prototyping with wrieframing tools Omnigraffle allows me to take a detailed look at the scale, position and typography. In this stage, I have used the actural words instead of <a href="http://www.lipsum.com/">Lorem Lpsum</a> so I could exam whether the box size is big enough and try out different typefaces. 

The earlier actual content is introduced, the better prototyping we could have.

<h3> High-fidelity Mockup with Photoshop </h3>
<br/>

Photoshop, Illustrator and Sketch are popular mockup tools among designers. They are very powerful and allows me to adjust the content position pixel by pixel, and the tiniest difference between two colors. They are so powerful with so many functions that it is time consuming to use. Also, it takes further efforts for further editting and modification. 

<div>
	<img class="col three" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/design/tokyo-marathon-web.jpg" alt="" title="example image"/>
</div>
<div class="col three caption">

</div>

ALternatively, lots of other applications like <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/">Foundation</a> and <a href="http://www.invisionapp.com/">inVision</a> amd online tools like <a href="https://moqups.com/"> Moqups.com</a> provide a more economic way to build nice and interactive mockup rapidly by providing highly usable templates.

<h3> Responsive Mockup with inVision </h3>
<br/>

inVision helps build rapid high-fidelity mockup. After uploading the design files, I quickly added animations, gestures and transitions so the static Photoshop design is transformed into clickable and interactive prototypes.

<div>
	<img class="col three" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/design/marathon-invision.png" alt="" title="example image"/>
</div>

<div class="col three caption">

</div>

With the inVision's "layer comps" feature, creating alternate scenes and managing data beceomes more handy in Photoshop. All we need are three symbols:

<ul>
	<li>Asterisk (*): to create global elements</li>
	<li>Ampersand (&): to create alternate screens</li>
	<li>Suffix after a layter for images (.png): to export indivisual assets</li>
</ul>
