BJ Fogg from Stamford University developed the Fogg Behaviour Model a few years back, which takes a closer look at how technology can be used to change what people think and do. It provides a systematic way to analyse and understand how companies such as Facebook, twitter and Instagram become a successful stories by understanding people’s needs and ultimately changed their behaviours.

The model itself is simple. By “simple”, I did not mean the theory was easy to built, but the model is presented and illustrated in a straightforward and elegant way, and could be applied universally on products that requires behaviour changes. You might understand more if you spend sometime by reading Fogg’s original post on his definition of simplicity.

In summary, Fogg’s Behaviour Model can be presented by this formula:

B=M.A.T

where B is behaviour, M is motivation, A is ability and T is trigger. So, user behaviour is a combined result of motivation, ability and trigger at the same time. It is further illustrated in the below diagram:

There are a few key insights that have stroked me and explained some common misunderstanding in product design and user analysis:

<h3> Facilitating rather than motivating behaviour change </h3>

Most of time we heard product managers are talking about designing a product to encourage people or motivate people to take actions. In fact, it is not easy to increase people’s motivation. However, people are more likely to change behaviours if they are being guided or facilitated on how to take a change.

For example, Nike expanded its market in China not only by advertising and branding on media platform, but also focusing on how to make exercise easier for customers.

<ul>
	<li> Invited world’s top runners to share running experience, technics in the selection of running shoes and training tips. </li>
	<li> Developed Nike+ Running APP in partnership with Spotify to guide runners to their goals when runners step in-beat to the prescribed songs. </li>
	<li> Sponsored local running club to promote running culture and build runners’ community </li>
	<li> Recruited pacers for Marathon runners and provided pacers with professional training so that pacers could help runners. </li>
</ul>

Nike is no longer a shoe manufacturer but a service provider facilitating runners. Given an increase in people’s ability and/or an easy access to running exercise, people are more likely to take a change, subsequently structure a habit change.

<h3> Simplicity is not a characteristic inherited in the product </h3>

When I learnt about Steve Jobs’ story of eliminating instruction manual for Apple product, I thought   simplicity was about the design of product or process. Whether a gadget or APP is easy and simple to use becomes a criterial if it is good. This is true, but only part of the whole story. As illustrated by Fogg’s model, “simplicity is the minimally satisfying solution at the lowest cost”, and it exists outside the product being determined by six factors: money, time, physical effort, brain cycle, social deviance and routine. It depends on both person and context. For example, running 10K is easy for a marathon runner while difficult for a people who seldom exercises, and putting on a skirt is simple while it’s difficult to as a man to wear a skirt unless he is in Scotland since this breaks a social rule.  Simplicity depend on both person and context.

For example, the Health Promotion Board of Singapore recently initiated the National Steps Challenge to promote the health life style. The program is designed in a simple way that everyone is able to dedicate some time to participate in it.

<h3> Trigger shall leads to a behaviour chain that happens naturally </h3> 


Fogg argues that a trigger should combine motivation and ability. The trigger should require a simple action if the motivation is low, then facilitate people to take further actions and grow tiny habits. This so-called behaviour chain completes the cycle of structuring a behaviour change.
